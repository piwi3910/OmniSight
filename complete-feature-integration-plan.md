3. Third-party extension management UI
4. Developer portal and documentation

## Database Schema Updates

The following database schema updates are needed to support the integration:

1. Camera table:
   - Add `protocolType` field (string)
   - Add `capabilities` field (JSON object)
   - Add `protocolSettings` field (JSON object)
   - Add `hardwareAcceleration` field (JSON object)

2. Stream table:
   - Add `protocol` field (string)
   - Add `quality` field (string)
   - Add `adaptiveBitrate` field (boolean)
   - Add `encryption` field (JSON object)

3. User table:
