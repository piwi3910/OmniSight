## Integration Strategy

### Protocol Selection Logic

We will implement a smart protocol selection system that will:

1. Attempt connection using the most efficient protocol first (WebRTC for low latency, RTSP for reliable streams)
2. Fall back to alternative protocols if primary connection fails
3. Automatically select the best protocol based on camera capabilities
4. Allow users to manually override protocol selection

### Protocol-Specific Optimization

Each protocol implementation will include:

1. Protocol-specific health monitoring and recovery
2. Performance metrics collection for comparison
3. Bandwidth usage optimization
4. Latency measurement and reporting
5. Compatibility information for frontend display

## Testing Strategy

### Compatibility Testing

We will test each protocol implementation with:

1. Major camera manufacturers (Hikvision, Axis, Dahua, Ubiquiti, Samsung)
2. Different camera models within each brand
3. Various firmware versions
4. Different network conditions (LAN, WAN, limited bandwidth)

### Performance Testing

Performance metrics to be collected:

1. Connection time
2. Stream startup latency
3. End-to-end latency
4. Frame rate stability
5. CPU and memory usage
6. Network bandwidth consumption

### Security Testing

Security aspects to be verified:

1. Authentication mechanism security
2. Stream encryption effectiveness
3. Resistance to common attacks
4. Proper credential handling
5. Access control enforcement

## Resources Required

### Development Resources

1. Test cameras from major manufacturers
2. Development environment with varying network conditions
3. WebRTC TURN/STUN server for testing
4. High-performance development machines for stream processing

### External Dependencies

1. WebRTC library and dependencies
2. ONVIF client libraries
3. Proprietary SDK access for major camera brands
4. HLS generation tools and libraries
