## API Consistency Analysis

Our analysis of the API endpoints across all services shows:

1. **API Route Naming**: Routes are consistently named following RESTful conventions
   - Resource-based routes: `/cameras`, `/events`, `/recordings`
   - Sub-resource routes follow consistent patterns: `/cameras/:id/stream`
   - Operation-specific actions use consistent verbs: `/recordings/:id/stop`

2. **Controller Function Naming**: Functions follow consistent naming patterns
   - CRUD operations: `getX`, `createX`, `updateX`, `deleteX`
   - List operations: `getAllX`, `getXByY`
   - Action verbs for operations: `startRecording`, `stopRecording`

3. **Response Formatting**: All API responses follow the same structure
   - Success responses include `status: "success"` and `data` field
   - Error responses include `status: "error"`, `message`, and optional `error` details
   - Pagination is consistently implemented with `total`, `page`, `limit`, `pages`

4. **Authentication**: Authentication is consistently applied across protected endpoints

## Frontend Feature Completeness

The frontend implementation includes all planned features:

1. **Core Views**
   - Dashboard with system overview
   - Camera grid with multi-camera view
   - Recordings browser with timeline
   - Events browser with filtering
   - Settings with all configuration options
   - System monitoring dashboard

2. **System Settings**
   - General settings with system configuration
   - Recording settings for video management
   - Detection settings for object detection
   - Notification settings for alerts
   - Hardware acceleration settings (newly added)
   - User account management

3. **Advanced Features**
   - PTZ camera controls
   - Advanced timeline controls
   - Video export with watermarking
   - Event notifications system
   - Hardware acceleration configuration

   - Integrate AMD AMF for hardware-accelerated encoding/decoding
   - Add ROCm support for video processing operations

2. **Implement Mobile and Embedded Acceleration**
   - Add support for Google Edge TPU, Rockchip NPU, and other embedded platforms
   - Create optimized inference paths for mobile devices
   - Implement power-efficient acceleration options for resource-constrained devices

3. **Add Proprietary Camera API Support**
   - Implement vendor-specific APIs for major camera manufacturers
   - Create adapter classes that map proprietary APIs to the abstraction layer
   - Add vendor-specific feature detection and utilization

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Ensure documentation is up-to-date with the latest implementations
   - Add detailed documentation for hardware acceleration configuration
   - Document supported camera vendors and their specific features

## Conclusion

The OmniSight implementation is robust and follows good software engineering practices, with consistent naming, proper error handling, and well-structured code organization. The remaining items in the implementation plan can be completed in the upcoming development cycle.

We've recently completed the frontend interface for hardware acceleration, providing users with a comprehensive UI to configure and optimize hardware acceleration settings. The implementation includes device information display, platform selection, and performance vs. power efficiency controls.
