## Detailed Implementation Notes

### Stream Handling Architecture

```
RTSP Camera → Stream Ingestion → RabbitMQ → [Recording Service, Object Detection]
                                           ↓
                                   Metadata & Events → WebSocket → Frontend
```

### Object Detection Pipeline

```
Video Frame → Worker Thread → TensorFlow.js → Object Detection → Event Generation → 
       ↓                                                               ↓
Thumbnail Generation                                           Database Storage → WebSocket Notification
```

### Recording Segmentation Strategy

- 10-minute segments by default (configurable)
- MP4 container format with H.264 encoding
- Index file for each recording with segment metadata
- Thumbnail generated for each segment
- Retention policy based on storage usage and time

### Storage Management

- Tiered storage with hot/cold options
- Automatic cleanup based on configurable retention
- Thumbnail generation for quick browsing
- Metadata storage separated from video files
- Event data retained longer than full video
