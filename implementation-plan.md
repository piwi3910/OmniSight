## Detailed Implementation Notes

### Stream Processing Pipeline

The Stream Ingestion Service now provides:

```
RTSP Camera → Stream Ingestion Service → RabbitMQ → [Recording Service, Object Detection]
                      ↓                                ↓
             Health Monitoring,               Frame Processing,
             Auto-reconnection                Event Generation
```

Key features implemented:
- Connection management with auto-reconnect capabilities
- Frame processing using FFmpeg
- RabbitMQ integration for frame distribution
- Stream status tracking and monitoring
- Error handling and failure recovery

### Recording Architecture

The recording flow will work as follows:

```
Video Frames → Recording Service → File Storage
                     ↓                  ↓
              Segment Creation     Metadata Storage
                     ↓
            Thumbnail Generation
```

### Object Detection Pipeline

```
Video Frame → Worker Thread → TensorFlow.js → Object Detection → Event Generation → 
       ↓                                                               ↓
Thumbnail Generation                                           Database Storage → WebSocket Notification
```

### Recording Segmentation Strategy

- 10-minute segments by default (configurable)
- MP4 container format with H.264 encoding
- Index file for each recording with segment metadata
- Thumbnail generated for each segment
- Retention policy based on storage usage and time

### Storage Management

- Tiered storage with hot/cold options
- Automatic cleanup based on configurable retention
- Thumbnail generation for quick browsing
- Metadata storage separated from video files
- Event data retained longer than full video
